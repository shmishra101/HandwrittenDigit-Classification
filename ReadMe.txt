This project is about classifiying the handwritten digits among digits from 0-9

Logistic Regression,Neural Network ,Random Forest ,SVM model is trained on MNIST dataset.Model is also tested on USPS dataset.It is observed that training the model on MNIST dataset and testing on USPS dataset results in very less accuracy on USPS dataset.

To analyze the performance of model Confusion matrix is build for all three models and class accuracy is determined.

All the classifier are combined using Majority Voting and Bagging method.
